Lukkari
=========
Timetable for students of Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK).

Description
-----------
The product provides the user a timetable for TAMK. The software fetches the
timetable data from TAMK Lukkarikone and then displays it to the user. The 
user can also view other group's timetables. 

The ability to export the timetable in ical format is also provided. User can
also set if they want to get a notification n minutes before the lesson starts.
(Exporting ical is currently only available if the user is logged in and actually
finds the feature from the menus.) This product is also mobile friendly, unlike 
Lukkarikone's interface.

The product will also feature a lunch list at least for Campusravita.
